## Compiling squirrel scripts

The very simple commandline compiler this is, has merely two arguments

    % sq-compiler [source file] [destination file]

So if you ever desired to compile `my-script.nut` to `my-compiled-script.nut`
you would use the following command-line code:

    % sq-compiler my-script.nut my-compiled-script.nut

Errors can have the following two formats:

    Error: $generic-error # not generated by squirrel but this program
    Error in $filename on line $line column $column: $error # generated by this compiler
